# wave function collapse

I am not going to explain what it is and how it works but it is used to procedurally create tilings and such.

### Some examples would be:
- hypixel skyblock dungeons (minecraft server) use this (probably)
- townscaper (on steam) uses this
- bad north (on steam) uses this
- this project uses this
